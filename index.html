    <p>
        Hi. I'm Sander. You probably landed on this page to learn a little
        more about me (check?). That's cool, but brace for prose.
    </p>

    <h2>Work</h2>
    <p>
        Despite appearances, I'm not a software engineer. I did start out as
        one, but discovered other types of work can be just as
        rewarding<sup>1)</sup>. I currently earn my daily bread as a
        <strong>full stack analyst</strong> <sup> 2)</sup> in a scrum team that
        builds an e-commerce site.
    </p>

    <h2>Side projects</h2>
    <p>
        I love <strong>text based modeling software</strong>, like
        <a href="http://www.mcternan.me.uk/mscgen/">MscGen</a> (sequence charts)
        and <a href="http://graphviz.org">Graphviz</a> (networks). Weirdly,
        tooling to work with that software is either non-existant or klunky.
    </p>
    <p>
        In 2013 I set out to change that. I implemented mscgen in
        JavaScript and put it on a website (<a href="https://mscgen.js.org">mscgen.js.org</a>).
        This meant I could use it from anywhere, and that I could learn from
        how others used it. That worked. Three years later there's a cli, an
        npm library, two little languages that expand upon the ideas in MscGen,
        syntax highlighting in codemirror and visual studio code.
        And a plugin for the Atom editor. Which is really awesome. You should
        try it. No, really.
    </p>
    <p>
        At the end of 2016 I set upon writing
        <a href="https://github.com/sverweij/dependency-cruiser">dependency-cruiser</a>
        <strong>dependency analyzer and visualizer</strong> for TypeScript (and
        hence JavaScript) to keep both my team and the chief architect happy.
        My team wanted to keep a mono-repo for a while to keep initial development
        manageable. Our chief architect was afraid we'd grow weird
        dependencies within that repo. With dependency-cruiser we could prove
        that concern unfounded, both visually and in our CI.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
        I have some <strong>other side projects</strong>; <a href="https://github.com/sverweij" title="Sander on GitHub">GitHub</a>
        is doing a decent job on showcasing them, so if you want to see them, hit over there.
    </p>

    <h2>Private life</h2>
    <p>
        I live in Holland. As does my girlfriend. Probably; I honestly don't
        know. I have never met her.
    </p>
    <p>
        To the best of my knowledge I don't have any kids either.
    </p>
    <p>
        Other random facts:
        <ul>
            <li>Hats are cool.</li>
            <li>The best time to go out for a walk is when it rains.</li>
            <li>Best purchase of 2015: leather walking shoes.</li>
            <li>I know how to assemble a
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromatic_harmonica">chromatic harmonica.</a>
            </li>
            <li>Best purchase of 2016: noise canceling head phones.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <h2>Social media</h2>
    <p>
        Apart from <a href="https://github.com/sverweij" title="Sander on GitHub">GitHub</a>,
        I have accounts on
        <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/sanderverweij" title="Sander's LinkedIn profile">LinkedIn</a>
        <a href="https://www.twitter.com/SanderSpeaks" title="Sander's Twitter account">Twitter</a> and
        <a href="https://plus.google.com/u/0/118369668878370776334" title="Sander on Google+">Google+</a>.
        Fair warning, though: I tend to check these once every two weeks, and
        sometimes less.

            And stakeholder management.
